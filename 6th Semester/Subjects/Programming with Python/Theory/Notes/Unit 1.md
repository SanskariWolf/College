**UNIT I: Python Fundamentals & Flow Control**

---

**PART 1: Introduction & Python Basics**

**1. Introduction to Python**

*   **What is Python?**
    *   A **high-level** programming language (reads like English, abstracts away complex computer details).
    *   **Interpreted** (code is run line-by-line by an interpreter, unlike compiled languages that need a full build step first). This makes it great for quick testing.
    *   **General-purpose** (can be used for web development, data science, scripting, AI, games, etc.).
    *   **Dynamically-typed** (you don't have to declare the type of a variable; Python figures it out at runtime).
    *   Known for its **readability and simplicity**. Often called "executable pseudocode."
*   **Why Python?**
    *   **Easy to Learn:** Syntax is clean and intuitive.
    *   **Large Standard Library:** Lots of pre-built tools ("batteries included").
    *   **Vast Ecosystem:** Many third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask).
    *   **Versatile:** Used in many different fields.
    *   **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Python is like a **friendly, powerful, and versatile helper** that speaks almost plain English.
    *   It's "interpreted," meaning it understands your commands one by one as you give them.

**2. Python Basics: Entering Expressions into the Interactive Shell**

*   **The Interactive Shell (or REPL):**
    *   REPL stands for **R**ead, **E**valuate, **P**rint, **L**oop.
    *   You type Python code, it reads it, evaluates it, prints the result, and waits for your next command.
    *   Accessed by typing `python` or `python3` in your terminal/command prompt.
    *   You'll see a prompt, usually `>>>`.
*   **Expressions:**
    *   A piece of code that **evaluates to a value**.
    *   Think of it like a math problem that Python solves.
    *   Examples:
        ```python
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        >>> 10 - 5 * 2
        0
        >>> (10 - 5) * 2
        10
        >>> "Hello" + " " + "World"
        'Hello World'
        ```
    *   Python follows standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   The `>>>` shell is your Python **playground or calculator**. You type something in, Python tells you the answer.
    *   An **expression** is anything that Python can "figure out" to be a single value.

**3. The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types**

*   **Data Types:** Categories for values. Python needs to know what *kind* of data it's working with.
*   **a. Integer (`int`)**
    *   Whole numbers (no decimal point).
    *   Examples: `-5`, `0`, `100`, `999999999`
    *   Code: `age = 25`

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   **Integers** are for counting whole things: apples, people, errors.

*   **b. Floating-Point (`float`)**
    *   Numbers with a decimal point.
    *   Used for measurements, calculations requiring precision.
    *   Examples: `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0` (even if the decimal part is zero, the `.0` makes it a float).
    *   Code: `price = 19.99`

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   **Floats** are for things that can be split or measured precisely: height, weight, money. Think of a decimal point "floating" in the number.

*   **c. String (`str`)**
    *   Sequences of characters (text).
    *   Must be enclosed in single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`). Be consistent!
    *   Examples: `"Hello"`, `'Python is fun!'`, `"123"` (this is a string, not an integer).
    *   Code: `name = "Alice"`

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   **Strings** are for words, sentences, any textual information. Think of them as "strings of characters" tied together by quotes.

**4. String Concatenation and Replication**

*   **a. String Concatenation (`+`)**
    *   Joining two or more strings together using the `+` operator.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        >>> "Hello" + " " + "World"
        'Hello World'
        >>> first_name = "John"
        >>> last_name = "Doe"
        >>> full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
        >>> print(full_name)
        John Doe
        ```
    *   **Important:** You can only concatenate strings with other strings. ` "Age: " + 25 ` will cause an error. You'd need to convert the number to a string: ` "Age: " + str(25) `.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Concatenation: **`+` glues strings together.**

*   **b. String Replication (`*`)**
    *   Repeating a string multiple times using the `*` operator with an integer.
    *   Example:
        ```python
        >>> "Ha" * 3
        'HaHaHa'
        >>> "---" * 10
        '------------------------------'
        ```
    *   **Important:** You can only replicate a string with an integer. ` "Hi" * "Bye" ` will error. ` "Hi" * 2.5 ` will also error.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Replication: **`*` copies a string N times.**

**5. Storing Values in Variables**

*   **What is a Variable?**
    *   A named placeholder or container in the computer's memory for storing data.
    *   You give it a name, and it holds a value. The value can change.
*   **Assignment Operator (`=`)**
    *   Used to assign a value to a variable.
    *   Syntax: `variable_name = value`
    *   The `=` sign means "assign the value on the right to the variable on the left."
    *   Examples:
        ```python
        message = "Hello Python!"  # message now holds the string "Hello Python!"
        count = 10                 # count now holds the integer 10
        pi_approx = 3.14           # pi_approx now holds the float 3.14
        ```
*   **Using Variables:**
    *   Once a value is stored, you can use the variable name in expressions as if it were the value itself.
        ```python
        x = 5
        y = 3
        result = x + y  # result will be 8
        print(result)
        ```
*   **Variable Naming Rules (Conventions):**
    *   Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
    *   Can be followed by letters, numbers (0-9), or underscores.
    *   **Case-sensitive:** `myVariable` is different from `myvariable`.
    *   Cannot be a Python keyword (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`, `str`, `int`).
    *   Convention: Use `lowercase_with_underscores` (snake_case) for variable names (e.g., `user_age`, `total_amount`).

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Variables are like **labeled boxes** where you store information.
    *   The `=` sign is like saying, "**Put this value into this box.**"
    *   Choose descriptive names for your "boxes" so you remember what's inside.

**6. Dissecting Your Program**

*   A Python program is a sequence of **statements**.
*   Python executes these statements one by one, from top to bottom (unless flow control changes this).
*   **Example Program:**
    ```python
    # This is a comment. Python ignores it.
    name = "Alice"          # Statement 1: Assignment
    age = 30                # Statement 2: Assignment

    # Statement 3: Expression (age + 5) and Function Call (print)
    print("Hello, " + name)
    print("You will be " + str(age + 5) + " in five years.")
    ```
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Comments (`#`):** Notes for humans. Python ignores anything after `#` on a line. Use them to explain your code.
    *   **Keywords:** Reserved words with special meaning (e.g., `print`, `if`, `def`).
    *   **Variables:** (`name`, `age`).
    *   **Operators:** Symbols that perform operations (`=`, `+`).
    *   **Literals:** The actual values typed directly into the code (`"Alice"`, `30`, `"Hello, "`).
    *   **Function Calls:** Using built-in or custom functions (`print()`, `str()`). The parentheses `()` indicate a function call.
    *   **Expressions:** Combinations of values, variables, and operators that Python evaluates to a single value (e.g., `age + 5`, `"Hello, " + name`).
    *   **Statements:** A complete instruction that Python can execute (e.g., `name = "Alice"` is an assignment statement).

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Your program is a **recipe**. Python follows the instructions (statements) step-by-step.
    *   `# Comments` are notes to yourself or other cooks.
    *   `print()` is how you get Python to "say" something.

**PART 2: Flow Control**

**7. Boolean Values (`bool`)**

*   A data type that can only have one of two values: **`True`** or **`False`**.
    *   Note the capitalization: `True`, `False` (not `true` or `false`).
*   Represent truth or falsehood, on or off, yes or no.
*   Crucial for making decisions in your programs.
*   Examples:
    ```python
    is_raining = True
    is_sunny = False
    has_permission = True
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Booleans are like a **light switch**: either `True` (on) or `False` (off).
    *   They answer **yes/no questions**.

**8. Comparison Operators (Relational Operators)**

*   Used to compare two values.
*   The result of a comparison is always a Boolean value (`True` or `False`).

    | Operator | Meaning                  | Example (if `a=5`, `b=10`) | Result  |
    | :------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :------ |
    | `==`     | Equal to                 | `a == 5`                   | `True`  |
    |          |                          | `a == b`                   | `False` |
    | `!=`     | Not equal to             | `a != b`                   | `True`  |
    |          |                          | `a != 5`                   | `False` |
    | `<`      | Less than                | `a < b`                    | `True`  |
    | `>`      | Greater than             | `a > b`                    | `False` |
    | `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `a <= 5`                   | `True`  |
    |          |                          | `a <= b`                   | `True`  |
    | `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= 5`                   | `True`  |
    |          |                          | `b >= a`                   | `True`  |

*   **Important:** `==` (comparison) is different from `=` (assignment).
    *   `x = 5`  means "assign the value 5 to x."
    *   `x == 5` means "is the value of x equal to 5?" (results in `True` or `False`).

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Comparison operators are **questions you ask Python about values**.
    *   `==` (double equals) is for "is it *really* equal?" (checking).
    *   `=` (single equals) is for "make it equal" (assigning).

**9. Boolean Operators (Logical Operators)**

*   Used to combine or modify Boolean values.
*   There are three main Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

*   **a. `and` Operator:**
    *   Returns `True` if **both** conditions are `True`. Otherwise, returns `False`.
    *   Truth Table:
        | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | `Condition1 and Condition2` |
        | :---------- | :---------- | :------------------------ |
        | `True`      | `True`      | `True`                    |
        | `True`      | `False`     | `False`                   |
        | `False`     | `True`      | `False`                   |
        | `False`     | `False`     | `False`                   |
    *   Example: `(age > 18) and (has_ticket == True)`

*   **b. `or` Operator:**
    *   Returns `True` if **at least one** of the conditions is `True`. Returns `False` only if both are `False`.
    *   Truth Table:
        | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | `Condition1 or Condition2` |
        | :---------- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
        | `True`      | `True`      | `True`                   |
        | `True`      | `False`     | `True`                   |
        | `False`     | `True`      | `True`                   |
        | `False`     | `False`     | `False`                  |
    *   Example: `is_weekend or is_holiday`

*   **c. `not` Operator:**
    *   Reverses the Boolean value. `not True` becomes `False`, and `not False` becomes `True`.
    *   Truth Table:
        | Condition | `not Condition` |
        | :-------- | :-------------- |
        | `True`    | `False`         |
        | `False`   | `True`          |
    *   Example: `not is_raining`

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `and`: **Both must be true.** (I want cake AND ice cream).
    *   `or`: **At least one must be true.** (I'll take coffee OR tea).
    *   `not`: **The opposite.** (If `is_tired` is `True`, then `not is_tired` is `False`).

**10. Mixing Boolean and Comparison Operators**

*   You can combine comparison operators and Boolean operators to create complex conditions.
*   Python evaluates comparison operators first, then `not`, then `and`, then `or`.
*   Use parentheses `()` to control the order of evaluation or to make conditions clearer.
*   Examples:
    ```python
    age = 25
    country = "USA"

    # Is the person an adult and from the USA?
    is_adult_usa = (age >= 18) and (country == "USA")  # True
    print(is_adult_usa)

    score = 75
    attended_all_classes = False

    # Passed if score >= 70 OR attended all classes
    passed = (score >= 70) or attended_all_classes # True (because score >= 70)
    print(passed)

    # Not a child (age is not less than 18)
    is_not_child = not (age < 18) # True
    print(is_not_child)
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Think of it like math: **do comparisons first**, then apply `not`, `and`, `or`.
    *   **Parentheses `()` are your best friend** for clarity and ensuring the correct order.

**11. Elements of Flow Control**

*   Flow control refers to the order in which the program's statements are executed.
*   Normally, Python executes code from top to bottom.
*   Flow control statements can cause Python to:
    *   **Skip** certain lines of code.
    *   **Repeat** certain lines of code.
    *   **Choose** between different paths of code.
*   These decisions are usually based on Boolean conditions.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Flow control is like a **traffic controller for your code**, directing which way it should go.
    *   Or, like a **choose-your-own-adventure book** where your choices (conditions) determine the next page (code block).

**12. Program Execution**

*   As mentioned, Python generally executes code sequentially, line by line from top to bottom.
*   When a flow control statement (like `if`) is encountered, Python evaluates its condition.
*   Based on the condition (`True` or `False`), the flow of execution might jump to a different part of the code or skip a block of code.

**13. Flow Control Statements (Conditional Execution)**

*   These statements allow your program to make decisions.
*   The primary ones are `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`.
*   **Indentation is CRUCIAL in Python.** It defines blocks of code associated with flow control statements. Use 4 spaces for indentation (common convention).

*   **a. `if` Statement:**
    *   Executes a block of code **only if** a condition is `True`.
    *   Syntax:
        ```python
        if condition:
            # This block of code (indented)
            # runs only if condition is True
            statement1
            statement2
        # Code here (not indented) runs regardless
        ```
    *   Example:
        ```python
        temperature = 30
        if temperature > 25:
            print("It's a hot day!")
        print("Enjoy your day.") # This will always print
        ```

*   **b. `else` Statement:**
    *   Executes a block of code if the `if` condition (or all preceding `elif` conditions) is `False`.
    *   It's optional and must come after an `if` or `elif` block.
    *   Syntax:
        ```python
        if condition:
            # Runs if condition is True
            statement_if_true
        else:
            # Runs if condition is False
            statement_if_false
        ```
    *   Example:
        ```python
        age = 16
        if age >= 18:
            print("You can vote.")
        else:
            print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
        ```

*   **c. `elif` Statement (Else If):**
    *   Allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.
    *   If the `if` condition is `False`, Python checks the `elif` condition. If that's `False`, it checks the next `elif`, and so on.
    *   If any `elif` condition is `True`, its block is executed, and the rest of the `elif`/`else` chain is skipped.
    *   An `else` block at the end is optional and acts as a catch-all.
    *   Syntax:
        ```python
        if condition1:
            # Runs if condition1 is True
            statement1
        elif condition2:
            # Runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
            statement2
        elif condition3:
            # Runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
            statement3
        else:
            # Runs if all preceding conditions are False
            statement_else
        ```
    *   Example:
        ```python
        score = 75
        if score >= 90:
            print("Grade: A")
        elif score >= 80:
            print("Grade: B")
        elif score >= 70:
            print("Grade: C")
        elif score >= 60:
            print("Grade: D")
        else:
            print("Grade: F")
        ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `if`: "**IF** this is true, do this."
    *   `elif`: "**ELSE IF** this other thing is true, do that." (A backup plan).
    *   `else`: "**OTHERWISE** (if nothing above was true), do this instead." (The final fallback).
    *   **INDENTATION MATTERS!** It tells Python which code belongs to which `if/elif/else`.

**14. Importing Modules**

*   **Modules:** Files containing Python definitions and statements (functions, variables, classes). They extend Python's capabilities.
*   Python's Standard Library has many useful modules. You can also create your own or use third-party modules.
*   **`import` Statement:** Used to bring the code from a module into your current program.
*   **How to Use:**
    1.  **Import the whole module:**
        ```python
        import math # Imports the math module

        result = math.sqrt(16) # Use functions from the module with module_name.function_name()
        print(result)          # Output: 4.0
        print(math.pi)         # Output: 3.141592653589793
        ```
    2.  **Import specific things from a module:**
        ```python
        from random import randint, choice # Imports only randint and choice functions

        roll = randint(1, 6)    # Can use randint directly
        print("You rolled:", roll)
        options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        computer_choice = choice(options) # Can use choice directly
        print("Computer chose:", computer_choice)
        ```
    3.  **Import a module with an alias (a shorter name):**
        ```python
        import numpy as np # Common practice for the numpy library

        # arr = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # Now use 'np' instead of 'numpy'
        ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Modules are like **toolkits**.
    *   `import math` means "Go get the 'math' toolkit."
    *   `math.sqrt()` means "From the 'math' toolkit, use the 'square root' tool."
    *   `from random import randint` means "From the 'random' toolkit, just grab the 'randint' tool so I can use it directly."

**15. Ending a Program Early with `sys.exit()`**

*   Sometimes, you need to stop your program's execution immediately, perhaps due to an error or because a critical condition is met.
*   The `sys` module contains functions and variables related to the Python interpreter and its environment.
*   The `sys.exit()` function tells Python to terminate the program.
*   **How to Use:**
    1.  First, you must `import sys`.
    2.  Then, call `sys.exit()`.
    *   You can optionally pass an argument to `sys.exit()` (e.g., a string message or an integer exit code), but it's not required for simply stopping the program.
    ```python
    import sys

    print("Program starting...")
    user_input = input("Enter 'exit' to quit: ")

    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Exiting program as requested.")
        sys.exit()  # Program stops here

    print("Program continues if you didn't type 'exit'.")
    # More code here...
    print("Program finished normally.")
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `sys.exit()` is like an **emergency stop button** for your program.
    *   You need to `import sys` first to "find" this button.

*   **Interactive Shell (`>>>`):** Python's calculator/playground.
*   **Data Types:**
    *   `int`: Whole counting numbers (apples).
    *   `float`: Numbers with decimals (measurements).
    *   `str`: Text in quotes ("strings of characters").
*   **String Ops:** `+` (glue strings), `*` (copy strings).
*   **Variables:** Labeled boxes (`= ` puts value in box). `lowercase_with_underscores`.
*   **Booleans (`True`, `False`):** Light switch (on/off), yes/no.
*   **Comparison Ops (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`):** Ask questions, get `True`/`False`. (Remember `==` for check, `=` for assign).
*   **Boolean Ops (`and`, `or`, `not`):**
    *   `and`: Both true.
    *   `or`: At least one true.
    *   `not`: Opposite.
*   **Flow Control (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** Traffic controller / Choose-your-own-adventure.
    *   **INDENTATION IS KING!** (4 spaces).
*   **Modules (`import`):** Toolkits. `import module_name`, then `module_name.tool()`.
*   **`sys.exit()`:** Emergency stop button (need `import sys` first).
