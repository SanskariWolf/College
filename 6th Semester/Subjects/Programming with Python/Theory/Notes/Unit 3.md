**UNIT III: Files and File Organization**

---

**PART 1: Reading and Writing Files**

Working with files is essential for programs that need to store data persistently (beyond the program's execution) or process existing data.

**1. Files and File Paths**

*   **What is a File?**
    *   A collection of data stored in one unit, identified by a filename.
    *   Think of it as a digital document on your computer (e.g., `my_document.txt`, `image.jpg`, `data.csv`).
*   **What is a File Path?**
    *   A string that specifies the location of a file or directory (folder) in the file system.
    *   It's like an address for a file.
*   **Types of Paths:**
    *   **Absolute Path:** Specifies the location from the very root of the file system.
        *   Always starts with the root directory.
        *   Examples:
            *   Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\report.txt`
            *   macOS/Linux: `/home/YourName/Documents/report.txt`
    *   **Relative Path:** Specifies the location relative to the current working directory (CWD).
        *   The CWD is the directory your script is "currently in."
        *   Does *not* start with the root directory.
        *   Uses special notations:
            *   `.` (dot): Refers to the current directory.
            *   `..` (dot-dot): Refers to the parent directory (one level up).
        *   Examples (if CWD is `/home/YourName/Documents`):
            *   `report.txt` (refers to `/home/YourName/Documents/report.txt`)
            *   `./report.txt` (same as above)
            *   `../Pictures/photo.jpg` (refers to `/home/YourName/Pictures/photo.jpg`)
*   **Path Separators:**
    *   Windows uses backslash (`\`).
    *   macOS and Linux use forward slash (`/`).
    *   **Important:** Python's `os` module helps handle these differences automatically.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   **File:** A digital **document**.
    *   **Path:** The **address** to find that document.
    *   **Absolute Path:** The **full street address** from the very beginning (e.g., "Earth, USA, California, ...").
    *   **Relative Path:** Directions **from where you are now** (e.g., "next door," "two blocks up").
    *   `.` = "this folder", `..` = "folder above this one".

**2. The `os.path` Module**

*   Python's `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, and `os.path` is a submodule specifically for common pathname manipulations.
*   You need to `import os`.
*   **Key `os.path` Functions:**
    *   `os.path.join(path_segment1, path_segment2, ...)`:
        *   **Crucial!** Constructs a valid path string by joining one or more path components. It intelligently uses the correct separator (`/` or `\`) for the current OS.
        *   Example: `os.path.join('folder1', 'folder2', 'file.txt')` might give `'folder1\\folder2\\file.txt'` on Windows or `'folder1/folder2/file.txt'` on Linux.
    *   `os.getcwd()`: (Get Current Working Directory) Returns the CWD as a string.
    *   `os.chdir(path)`: (Change Directory) Changes the CWD to `path`.
    *   `os.path.abspath(path)`: Returns the absolute path of `path`.
    *   `os.path.isabs(path)`: Returns `True` if `path` is an absolute path, `False` otherwise.
    *   `os.path.relpath(path, start)`: Returns a relative path to `path` from the `start` directory (defaults to CWD if `start` is omitted).
    *   `os.path.dirname(path)`: Returns the directory name part of `path`.
        *   `os.path.dirname('/usr/bin/spam')` -> `'/usr/bin'`
    *   `os.path.basename(path)`: Returns the base name (file or last folder) part of `path`.
        *   `os.path.basename('/usr/bin/spam')` -> `'spam'`
    *   `os.path.split(path)`: Returns a tuple of `(dirname, basename)`.
    *   `os.path.exists(path)`: Returns `True` if `path` refers to an existing file or directory.
    *   `os.path.isfile(path)`: Returns `True` if `path` is an existing regular file.
    *   `os.path.isdir(path)`: Returns `True` if `path` is an existing directory.
    *   `os.path.getsize(path)`: Returns the size of the file at `path` in bytes.
    *   `os.listdir(path)`: Returns a list of strings for all files and directories in `path`.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `os.path` is your **map and navigation toolkit** for file addresses.
    *   `os.path.join()`: The **smart way to build addresses** that work everywhere.
    *   `getcwd()`: "Where am I?"
    *   `exists()`: "Does this address even exist?"
    *   `isfile()` / `isdir()`: "Is it a file or a folder?"

**3. The File Reading/Writing Process**

*   The general process involves three steps:
    1.  **Open** the file.
    2.  **Read from** or **Write to** the file.
    3.  **Close** the file.
*   **a. Opening Files (`open()` function):**
    *   `file_object = open(filename, mode)`
    *   `filename`: String containing the path to the file.
    *   `mode`: String indicating how the file will be used. Common modes:
        *   `'r'`: Read mode (default). File must exist.
        *   `'w'`: Write mode. Creates a new file (or overwrites an existing one).
        *   `'a'`: Append mode. Adds new content to the end of an existing file. Creates the file if it doesn't exist.
        *   `'r+'`: Read and write mode. File must exist.
        *   Add `'b'` for binary mode (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'` for non-text files like images).
*   **b. Reading from Files (methods of the file object):**
    *   `content = file_object.read()`: Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.
    *   `line = file_object.readline()`: Reads a single line from the file, including the newline character (`\n`). Returns an empty string at EOF (End Of File).
    *   `lines_list = file_object.readlines()`: Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, each string including its `\n`.
*   **c. Writing to Files (methods of the file object):**
    *   `file_object.write(string_data)`: Writes `string_data` to the file. Does not automatically add a newline character. You need to add `\n` if you want new lines.
*   **d. Closing Files (`close()` method):**
    *   `file_object.close()`
    *   **Crucial!** Frees up system resources and ensures that all data written is actually saved (flushed) to the disk.
*   **The `with` Statement (Context Manager - Best Practice):**
    *   Automatically handles closing the file, even if errors occur.
    *   Syntax:
        ```python
        with open(filename, mode) as file_object:
            # Perform operations on file_object
            # content = file_object.read()
            # file_object.write("some text\n")
        # File is automatically closed here, no need for file_object.close()
        ```
    *   Example:
        ```python
        # Writing to a file
        with open("my_data.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("Hello, world!\n")
            f.write("This is a second line.\n")

        # Reading from a file
        with open("my_data.txt", "r") as f:
            content = f.read()
            print(content)
        ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   Think of it like working with a **physical book**:
        1.  `open()`: **Open the book.**
        2.  `read()`/`write()`: **Read pages or write notes in it.**
        3.  `close()`: **Close the book** (important, or you might lose your page/notes!).
    *   `with open(...) as f:`: The **magic self-closing book** â€“ highly recommended!

**4. Saving Variables with the `shelve` Module**

*   The `shelve` module allows you to save Python variables (like lists and dictionaries) to a binary "shelf" file.
*   It behaves like a persistent dictionary: you store data with keys and can retrieve it later, even after your program closes.
*   **How to Use:**
    1.  `import shelve`
    2.  `shelf_file = shelve.open(filename)`: Opens (or creates) a shelf file. `filename` is often given a `.db` or `.dat` extension, but it's not strict.
    3.  Treat `shelf_file` like a dictionary:
        *   `shelf_file['my_key'] = my_variable` (to save)
        *   `retrieved_variable = shelf_file['my_key']` (to load)
    4.  `shelf_file.close()`: **Important** to save changes and close the file. Can also use a `with` statement.
*   Example:
    ```python
    import shelve

    # Storing data
    with shelve.open('my_shelf_data') as sf: # .db, .bak, .dat files might be created
        sf['cats'] = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']
        sf['user_settings'] = {'theme': 'dark', 'font_size': 12}

    # Retrieving data in another run or another script
    with shelve.open('my_shelf_data') as sf:
        print(sf['cats'])               # Output: ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']
        print(sf['user_settings']['theme']) # Output: dark
    ```
*   Shelf files are binary and not human-readable. Only Python programs using `shelve` can easily read them.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `shelve` is like a **magic persistent dictionary** or a **simple database shelf** for your Python variables.
    *   You put your Python objects (variables) on the shelf with a label (key), and they stay there even when you turn off the lights (close the program).

**5. Saving Variables with `pprint.pformat()` Function**

*   If you want to save a Python data structure (like a list or dictionary) in a human-readable text file that is also a valid Python code string, you can use `pprint.pformat()`.
*   `pprint` stands for "pretty print."
*   `pformat()` ("pretty format") returns a string representation of the object that can be written to a `.py` file. This file can then be imported as a module to get the data back.
*   **How to Use:**
    1.  `import pprint`
    2.  `string_representation = pprint.pformat(your_variable)`
    3.  Write this string to a `.py` file.
    4.  Later, you can `import` that file to get the variable.
*   Example:
    ```python
    import pprint

    my_data = [{'name': 'Alice', 'species': 'cat'}, {'name': 'Bob', 'species': 'dog'}]

    # Saving the data
    formatted_string = pprint.pformat(my_data)
    with open('my_config_data.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write('saved_data = ' + formatted_string + '\n') # Make it an assignment

    # In another script or later:
    # (Assuming my_config_data.py is in the Python path)
    # from my_config_data import saved_data
    # print(saved_data)
    # print(saved_data[0]['name']) # Output: Alice
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `pprint.pformat()` creates a **perfectly formatted recipe (as a string)** of your data structure.
    *   You can save this recipe into a `.py` file, and Python can read it back as if it were code defining that data.

**PART 2: Organizing Files**

Managing files and directories programmatically.

**6. The `shutil` Module (Shell Utilities)**

*   The `shutil` module provides functions for higher-level file operations like copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories.
*   You need to `import shutil`.
*   **Key `shutil` Functions:**
    *   `shutil.copy(source, destination)`:
        *   Copies the file at `source` path to the `destination` path.
        *   If `destination` is a folder, the file is copied into it with the same basename.
        *   If `destination` is a filename, it copies and renames.
        *   Returns the path of the new copied file.
    *   `shutil.copytree(source_dir, destination_dir)`:
        *   Copies the entire directory tree (folder and all its contents, including subfolders) from `source_dir` to `destination_dir`.
        *   `destination_dir` must not already exist.
    *   `shutil.move(source, destination)`:
        *   Moves the file or folder at `source` to `destination`.
        *   If `destination` is a folder, `source` is moved into it.
        *   If `destination` points to a non-existent path (but in an existing folder), `source` is moved and renamed.
        *   Can be used to rename files/folders within the same directory.
    *   **Deleting (Be Careful! These are permanent deletions, not to Recycle Bin/Trash):**
        *   `os.remove(path)`: Deletes a single file at `path`. (From `os` module)
        *   `os.rmdir(path)`: Deletes an *empty* directory at `path`. (From `os` module)
        *   `shutil.rmtree(path)`: **Deletes an entire directory tree** (folder and all its contents). Use with extreme caution!
*   Example:
    ```python
    import shutil
    import os

    # Create some dummy files/folders for demonstration
    os.makedirs('original_folder/subfolder', exist_ok=True)
    with open('original_folder/file1.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('content1')
    with open('original_folder/subfolder/file2.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('content2')

    # Copying a file
    shutil.copy('original_folder/file1.txt', 'original_folder/file1_copy.txt')

    # Copying a directory tree
    shutil.copytree('original_folder', 'backup_folder')

    # Moving (renaming) a file
    shutil.move('original_folder/file1_copy.txt', 'original_folder/file1_renamed.txt')

    # Deleting a file
    os.remove('original_folder/file1_renamed.txt')

    # Deleting a directory tree (use with caution!)
    # Make sure you want to do this before uncommenting:
    # shutil.rmtree('original_folder')
    # shutil.rmtree('backup_folder')
    print("shutil operations (mostly) complete. Check your file system.")
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `shutil` is your **digital moving company or janitor** for files and folders.
    *   `copy()`: Make a photocopy.
    *   `copytree()`: Photocopy the whole filing cabinet.
    *   `move()`: Relocate or rename.
    *   `rmtree()`: **DEMOLISH** the entire building (folder) and everything in it. **Handle with care!**

**7. Walking a Directory Tree (`os.walk()`)**

*   `os.walk(top_directory_path)` is a generator function that allows you to iterate over all files and folders within a directory tree, starting from `top_directory_path`.
*   For each directory it visits (including `top_directory_path` itself), `os.walk()` yields a 3-tuple:
    *   `(current_folder_path, list_of_subfolder_names, list_of_filenames)`
        *   `current_folder_path`: A string, the path to the current folder.
        *   `list_of_subfolder_names`: A list of strings, names of subfolders in `current_folder_path`.
        *   `list_of_filenames`: A list of strings, names of files in `current_folder_path`.
*   Typically used in a `for` loop.
*   Example:
    ```python
    import os

    # Create a sample directory structure for os.walk
    os.makedirs('example_walk/folderA/subA1', exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs('example_walk/folderB', exist_ok=True)
    with open('example_walk/file_root.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('root')
    with open('example_walk/folderA/file_A.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('A')
    with open('example_walk/folderA/subA1/file_subA1.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('subA1')
    with open('example_walk/folderB/file_B.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('B')

    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('./example_walk'):
        print(f"Current Folder: {foldername}")
        for subfolder in subfolders:
            print(f"  SUBFOLDER OF {foldername}: {subfolder}")
        for filename in filenames:
            print(f"  FILE INSIDE {foldername}: {filename}")
        print('') # Add a newline for readability

    # Clean up (optional)
    # import shutil
    # shutil.rmtree('example_walk')
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `os.walk()` is like a **diligent explorer or census taker** for your folders.
    *   It systematically visits every room (folder) in a building (directory tree), and for each room, it tells you:
        1.  The room's address (`foldername`).
        2.  Which other rooms connect directly from this one (`subfolders`).
        3.  What items (`filenames`) are in this room.

**8. Compressing Files with the `zipfile` Module**

*   The `zipfile` module allows you to create, read, write, append, and list ZIP archives.
*   ZIP files are a common way to package multiple files and folders into a single compressed file.
*   You need to `import zipfile`.
*   **Key Operations:**
    *   **Creating/Writing to a ZIP file:**
        *   Open in write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode.
        *   Use `ZipFile.write(filename_to_add, arcname=None, compress_type=None)`
            *   `filename_to_add`: Path to the file on disk.
            *   `arcname`: Optional, how the file should be named *inside* the ZIP. Defaults to `filename_to_add`'s basename.
            *   `compress_type`: e.g., `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED` for compression.
        ```python
        import zipfile
        import os

        # Create dummy files to zip
        with open('file_to_zip1.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('This is file 1.')
        os.makedirs('folder_to_zip', exist_ok=True)
        with open('folder_to_zip/file_to_zip2.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('This is file 2 in a folder.')

        # Create a new ZIP file
        with zipfile.ZipFile('my_archive.zip', 'w', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as new_zip:
            new_zip.write('file_to_zip1.txt')
            new_zip.write('folder_to_zip/file_to_zip2.txt', arcname='renamed_in_zip.txt') # Custom name in archive
            # To add an entire folder, you'd typically os.walk() it and add files individually.
        print("my_archive.zip created.")
        ```
    *   **Reading from a ZIP file:**
        *   Open in read (`'r'`) mode.
        *   `ZipFile.namelist()`: Returns a list of all file and folder names within the ZIP.
        *   `ZipFile.getinfo(name_in_zip)`: Returns a `ZipInfo` object with details about a specific member.
        ```python
        # Reading from the ZIP file
        with zipfile.ZipFile('my_archive.zip', 'r') as my_zip_read:
            print("Files in ZIP:", my_zip_read.namelist())
            info = my_zip_read.getinfo('file_to_zip1.txt')
            print(f"Info for file_to_zip1.txt: Size={info.file_size}, Compressed={info.compress_size}")
        ```
    *   **Extracting from a ZIP file:**
        *   `ZipFile.extractall(path=None, members=None, pwd=None)`: Extracts all members to `path` (defaults to CWD).
        *   `ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)`: Extracts a single member.
        ```python
        # Extracting from the ZIP file
        os.makedirs('extracted_files', exist_ok=True)
        with zipfile.ZipFile('my_archive.zip', 'r') as my_zip_extract:
            my_zip_extract.extractall('extracted_files')
        print("Files extracted to 'extracted_files' folder.")

        # Clean up dummy files (optional)
        # os.remove('file_to_zip1.txt')
        # shutil.rmtree('folder_to_zip')
        # os.remove('my_archive.zip')
        # shutil.rmtree('extracted_files')
        ```
    *   Always `close()` the `ZipFile` object, or preferably, use a `with` statement.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `zipfile` is your **digital luggage compressor and decompressor.**
    *   `ZipFile(..., 'w')`: Packing your suitcase. `zf.write()`: Putting items in.
    *   `ZipFile(..., 'r')`: Opening your suitcase. `zf.namelist()`: Seeing what's inside. `zf.extractall()`: Taking everything out.
