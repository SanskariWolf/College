**UNIT IV: Web Scraping**

---

Web scraping is the process of programmatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages and then parsing the HTML content to find and collect the desired information.

**1. Project: MAPIT.PY with the `webbrowser` Module**

*   **Goal:** A script that launches a map in the browser using an address from the command line or clipboard.
*   **`webbrowser` Module:**
    *   A built-in Python module that provides a high-level interface to allow displaying Web-based documents to users.
    *   It can open a URL in the default web browser.
    *   Key function: `webbrowser.open(url)` or `webbrowser.open_new_tab(url)`.
*   **Required External Modules (for a typical `mapit.py`):**
    *   `sys`: To access command-line arguments (`sys.argv`).
    *   `pyperclip`: (Third-party, install with `pip install pyperclip`) To copy from/paste to the clipboard.
*   **How it Works (Conceptual Steps for `mapit.py`):**
    1.  Get the street address from:
        *   Command line arguments (if provided).
        *   The clipboard (if no command line arguments).
    2.  Construct the Google Maps URL: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/<ADDRESS_STRING>`
    3.  Use `webbrowser.open()` to launch the URL.
*   **Example Code Snippet (Illustrative):**
    ```python
    import webbrowser
    import sys
    import pyperclip # You'd need to install this: pip install pyperclip

    base_url = "https://www.google.com/maps/place/"

    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        # Get address from command line.
        # sys.argv is a list: ['mapit.py', 'arg1', 'arg2', ...]
        address = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    else:
        # Get address from clipboard.
        address = pyperclip.paste()

    if address:
        webbrowser.open(base_url + address)
        print(f"Opening map for: {address}")
    else:
        print("No address provided either in command line or clipboard.")
    ```
    *   To run: `python mapit.py 870 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110`
    *   Or, copy an address, then run: `python mapit.py`

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `webbrowser` is like a **simple remote control for your browser**: it just tells it which web page (URL) to open.
    *   `mapit.py` is a **quick address-to-map launcher**.

**2. Downloading Files from the Web with the `requests` Module**

*   **`requests` Module:**
    *   A very popular third-party Python library for making HTTP requests (simpler and more user-friendly than Python's built-in `urllib`).
    *   You need to install it: `pip install requests`.
*   **Making a Request:**
    *   The most common request is a `GET` request, used to retrieve data from a URL.
    *   `response_object = requests.get(url)`
*   **The Response Object:**
    *   The `requests.get()` function returns a `Response` object, which contains the server's response to your request.
    *   Key attributes/methods of the `Response` object:
        *   `response.status_code`: The HTTP status code (e.g., `200` for OK, `404` for Not Found).
        *   `response.text`: The content of the response, as a string (decoded text, good for HTML, text files).
        *   `response.content`: The content of the response, as bytes (good for images, ZIP files, other binary data).
        *   `response.headers`: A dictionary-like object of response headers.
        *   `response.raise_for_status()`: A useful method that will raise an `HTTPError` exception if the request returned an unsuccessful status code (4xx or 5xx). This is good for checking if the download was successful before proceeding.
*   **Example:**
    ```python
    import requests

    url = 'https://automatetheboringstuff.com/files/rj.txt' # Romeo and Juliet text
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check if the request was successful

        print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        print(f"First 500 characters of content:\n{response.text[:500]}")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   `requests` is like a **polite and efficient messenger** you send to a website (URL).
    *   `requests.get(url)`: "Messenger, go GET me what's at this URL."
    *   `response.text` / `response.content`: What the messenger brought back (the letter/package).
    *   `response.raise_for_status()`: "Messenger, let me know immediately if there was a problem delivering my request!"

**3. Saving Downloaded Files to the Hard Drive**

*   Once you've downloaded content using `requests` (e.g., `response.content` for binary files or `response.text` for text files), you can save it to your local hard drive using Python's standard file I/O operations (from Unit III).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Make a `GET` request to the URL of the file.
    2.  Open a local file in **write binary mode (`'wb'`)** for binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) or **write text mode (`'w'`)** for text files.
    3.  Write the content from the `Response` object to the local file.
        *   For large files, it's good practice to write in chunks using `response.iter_content(chunk_size)`.
    4.  Close the local file (or use a `with` statement).
*   **Example (Saving an image):**
    ```python
    import requests
    import os

    # Example image URL (replace with a real one if this becomes invalid)
    image_url = 'https://automatetheboringstuff.com/images/cover.png'
    filename = 'python_book_cover.png'

    try:
        response = requests.get(image_url)
        response.raise_for_status() # Check for errors

        # Save the image content to a file
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f: # 'wb' for write binary
            # For potentially large files, write in chunks
            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192): # 8KB chunks
                f.write(chunk)
        print(f"Image '{filename}' downloaded successfully.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error downloading image: {e}")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error saving file: {e}")
    ```

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   The `requests` messenger **delivers the package (`response.content`)**.
    *   You then use your standard file tools (`open()`, `write()`) to **store that package in a local box (file)**.
    *   `'wb'` (write binary) is crucial for non-text files like images, so they don't get corrupted.

**4. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

*   **What is HTML?**
    *   The standard markup language used to create and structure web pages.
    *   It describes the content and layout of a webpage using "tags."
    *   Web browsers read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages.
*   **Basic Structure of an HTML Document:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Document type declaration -->
    <html>         <!-- Root element -->
        <head>     <!-- Contains meta-information (not displayed) -->
            <title>Page Title</title> <!-- Shows in browser tab/title bar -->
            <!-- Other meta tags, links to CSS, scripts -->
        </head>
        <body>     <!-- Contains the visible page content -->
            <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph of text with a <a href="https://example.com">link</a>.</p>
            <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
            <div> <!-- A generic container -->
                <ul> <!-- Unordered list -->
                    <li>Item 1</li>
                    <li>Item 2</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
*   **Key HTML Concepts for Web Scraping:**
    *   **Tags:** Keywords surrounded by angle brackets, like `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<div>`, `<span>`.
        *   Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag `<p>` and a closing tag `</p>`.
        *   Some tags are self-closing, like `<img>` or `<br>`.
    *   **Elements:** An HTML element usually consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag (e.g., `<p>Some text.</p>`).
    *   **Attributes:** Provide additional information about an element. They are specified in the start tag.
        *   Format: `attribute_name="value"`
        *   Examples:
            *   `<a href="https://example.com">` (`href` is an attribute specifying the link's URL)
            *   `<img src="image.png" alt="My Image">` (`src` specifies image source, `alt` specifies alternative text)
            *   `<p id="intro" class="main-text">` (`id` is a unique identifier, `class` is used to group elements for styling/scripting)
*   **Why Understand HTML for Scraping?**
    *   When you download a web page with `requests`, you get its raw HTML content (`response.text`).
    *   To extract specific pieces of data (like a product price, a news headline, or a link), you need to identify the HTML tags and attributes that contain or surround that data.
    *   You then use parsing tools (like Beautiful Soup, covered briefly below, or regular expressions) to navigate the HTML structure and pull out the information based on these tags and attributes.

    *Easy to Remember:*
    *   HTML is the **blueprint or skeleton of a web page**.
    *   **Tags** are like the **bones** (`<p>`, `<h1>`).
    *   **Attributes** are like **labels or properties on those bones** (`id="main-article"`, `class="price"`).
    *   To scrape, you're essentially reading this blueprint to find the specific "room" or "item" (data) you're interested in.

*(The syllabus provided only lists "HTML". Usually, "Parsing HTML" with a library like Beautiful Soup follows directly. If Beautiful Soup is not part of your specific syllabus for this unit, you would rely on string methods or regular expressions to find patterns in the `response.text`, which is more complex and brittle. However, understanding HTML structure is the first step regardless of the parsing method.)*

**General Considerations for Web Scraping (Ethical and Practical):**

1.  **Check `robots.txt`:** Most websites have a `/robots.txt` file (e.g., `www.example.com/robots.txt`) that indicates which parts of the site web crawlers should or should not access. Respect these rules.
2.  **Read Terms of Service:** Some websites explicitly prohibit scraping in their Terms of Service.
3.  **Be Gentle on Servers:**
    *   Don't send too many requests too quickly. This can overload the server and get your IP address blocked.
    *   Use `time.sleep()` between requests to add delays.
4.  **Identify Your Bot (User-Agent):** Sometimes it's good practice to set a custom `User-Agent` header in your requests so the website knows who is scraping (e.g., `headers = {'User-Agent': 'MyCoolScraper/1.0 (myemail@example.com)'}`).
5.  **Websites Change:** HTML structures of websites can change without notice, which can break your scrapers. Be prepared to update your code.
6.  **Legal and Ethical:** Always scrape responsibly and ethically. Do not misuse data or violate privacy.

**Note on Next Steps (Beyond this Syllabus Section for Unit IV):**

After understanding HTML, the next logical step in web scraping is **parsing HTML**. This involves using libraries to make it easier to navigate the HTML structure and extract data.

*   **Beautiful Soup (`bs4`):** A very popular Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from the page source that can be used to extract data in a more robust and Pythonic way than string searching or regular expressions alone.
    *   Example: `soup.select('p.classname')` might find all paragraph elements with a specific CSS class.
*   **LXML:** Another powerful and fast library for processing XML and HTML.
*   **Regular Expressions (`re` module):** Can be used for pattern matching within the HTML text, but generally more fragile for complex HTML structures compared to dedicated parsers.

If your course covers these parsing tools, they build directly on the foundation of understanding HTML and using `requests`.

**Key Takeaways & Mnemonics Summary (UNIT-IV):**

*   **`webbrowser` module:** Simple **browser remote control** (`webbrowser.open(url)`).
*   **`requests` module:** Polite **web messenger** (`requests.get()`).
    *   `response.text/content`: The **message/package** received.
    *   `response.raise_for_status()`: Check for **delivery problems**.
*   **Saving Files:** `requests` delivers, `open('file', 'wb')` stores it locally.
*   **HTML:** The **blueprint/skeleton** of web pages.
    *   **Tags (`<p>`):** Bones.
    *   **Attributes (`id="nav"`):** Labels on bones.
    *   Crucial to understand for finding data to scrape.
*   **Ethical Scraping:** Be a good web citizen (check `robots.txt`, don't overload servers).

This unit provides the foundational tools for interacting with the web from Python. Mastering `requests` and understanding HTML structure are key for any web scraping task.
